# Mateysh's IT Portfolio | Software Development, AI & Systems

Hi, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

## Profile
I’m a Bachelor of Computer Science student at Monash University with a strong interest in software engineering, artificial intelligence, and mobile and web application development. I enjoy building practical, real-world systems and applying clean architecture principles to create scalable and maintainable software.

Through university projects, hackathons, and industry experience, I have developed skills across full-stack development, Android app development, and backend systems, with a growing focus on AI-powered applications.

## Projects & Learning
I am constantly building and refining my technical abilities through coursework, hackathons, and personal projects. Some of my key projects include:

- **NutriTrack** – A multi-screen Android nutrition application built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, integrating Room DB, external APIs (FruityVice, Gemini AI), and MVVM architecture to provide personalised health insights.

- **NEXA** – A university student networking platform built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase, designed to connect students through academics, social life, and career interests. Features include authentication, event hubs, and AI-based peer matching.

- **Study Buddy AI (Macathon 2025)** – A web application that transforms lecture PDFs into personalised practice questions using generative AI, built with Flask, React, and Supabase.

## Technical Skills
**Languages:** Python, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, SQL  
**Frameworks:** Flask, Jetpack Compose, React  
**Databases:** Oracle SQL, Room DB, Supabase  
**Tools:** Git, GitLab, SQL Developer, SharedPreferences  
**Concepts:**

- Android App Development  
- Web & Backend Development  
- API Integration  
- MVVM & Clean Architecture  


## Beyond IT
Outside of software development, I enjoy playing badminton and I’m a car enthusiast with a strong interest in automotive technology and performance engineering. These interests reflect my curiosity about how complex systems work, both in software and in the real world.
